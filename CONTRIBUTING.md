# Contributing

### Api

Currently, in order to contribute to this project, you will need your own
ProPublica Congress API key.
[You can request one here](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/api/propublica-congress-api)

I am working on getting a setup (either via mocks or by a public API server to
act as a proxy) that will make this no longer necessary. Until then, you need an
API key. 

### Style

The style guide here used is XO with one change: no semi-colons.
